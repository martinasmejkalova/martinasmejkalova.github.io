    <h1>Welcome to Martina's GitHub Page</h1>
    <p>Hi there, I'm Martina and I'm passionate about visualizing data. With my knowledge of SQL and expertise in Tableau and PowerBI, I create interactive and engaging visualizations using datasets downloaded from Kaggle and other sources. You can explore all of my data visualization projects on this page, along with access to the source codes on GitHub.</p>
    <p>The website has been designed by "HTML 5 UP" and provides a sleek and modern design that is both easy to navigate and pleasing to the eye. You can visit my website at <a href="https://martinasmejkalova.github.io/">https://martinasmejkalova.github.io/</a>.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my page and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.</p>
